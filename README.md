# Shashura Mobile Money for CampTix

Accept MTN and Airtel Mobile Money for [CampTix](https://wordpress.org/plugins/camptix/) ticket sales in Uganda, settled through the [Shashura](https://shashura.com) payment gateway.

> Not affiliated with, or endorsed by, the CampTix project.

## What it does

Shashura Mobile Money for CampTix adds MTN and Airtel Mobile Money as a payment option for CampTix, the WordPress event ticketing plugin used by WordCamp and community events. It's built for organisers selling tickets in Uganda who need a payment method their attendees already use day to day.

A Shashura merchant account is required to use this plugin. Sign up or log in at [shashura.com](https://shashura.com).

The plugin connects CampTix to the Shashura Mobile Money API and handles the full collection lifecycle: number verification, the PIN push to the buyer's phone, settlement confirmation, and reconciliation. It runs against either Shashura's Sandbox or Production environment, and endpoint overrides are controlled by trusted deployment code, never per-site settings. See [ENDPOINT-POLICY.md](ENDPOINT-POLICY.md) for migration and development testing.

## How a payment works

1. The buyer selects Mobile Money at checkout and enters their MTN or Airtel number.
2. The number is verified against the network before anything is charged. The registered subscriber name is hidden by default; site administrators may opt to show a partial or full name.
3. A PIN prompt is pushed to the buyer's phone for the exact order total.
4. The plugin confirms the payment with Shashura directly rather than trusting the browser or an incoming webhook on their own. Both only trigger a check; only a successful status enquiry for the stored payment attempt, with the expected amount and (where already known) matching Shashura transaction ID, can mark it paid. The gateway may replace external_ref after settlement, so it is not used as a post-settlement equality check.
5. Once confirmed, the buyer is taken to their CampTix ticket page and receives CampTix's standard confirmation email.

**PIN-approval step**: the countdown matches the time before a new prompt can be sent. An optional "Powered by Shashura" credit can be shown below the payment pages; it is off by default.

## Reliability and safety

- Every payment prompt on an order is tracked and reconciled, including ones approved after a buyer tried more than once.
- A duplicate payment on the same order is detected and flagged to the site administrator for a manual refund, rather than accepted or dropped silently.
- Incoming webhooks are verified against an HMAC-SHA256 signature. Unsigned, forged, oversized or mismatched-environment events are rejected.
- A per-order lock stops the webhook, the buyer's browser, an order cancellation and CampTix's own timeout sweep from recording conflicting outcomes for the same order at the same time.
- A payment approved after an order was cancelled or timed out is still recognised and completes the order.
- Works with current CampTix (2.x), the version WordCamp.org runs. CampTix 1.4.x also works, with one known limitation: when a webhook settles an order, CampTix 1.x ends the request itself, so Shashura gets an empty reply instead of the plugin's response. The order is still updated.

The public repository contains standalone regression tests with in-memory WordPress/CampTix doubles and mocked gateway responses. Run `php bin/test.php` or `composer test`; GitHub Actions runs the suite on PHP 7.4, 8.2 and 8.4. Coverage and remaining integration gaps are documented in [tests/README.md](https://github.com/Techdom-Digital-Solutions-U-limited/shashura-mobile-money-for-CampTix/blob/main/tests/README.md). The historical 92-check end-to-end suite and independent security-review report are not published here; the public regressions do not substantiate those claims.

## Requirements

- CampTix, with the ticket currency set to UGX.
- A Shashura merchant account with an app configured for Mobile Money collections, and its Client ID, Client Secret and Webhook Secret.
- A publicly reachable site, with the server's outbound IP whitelisted on the Shashura app, so callbacks and settlement can reach the plugin.

## Installation

1. Install and activate CampTix. Under **Tickets → Setup → General**, set the ticket currency to UGX.
2. Under **Plugins → Add New**, search for "Shashura Mobile Money for CampTix", then install and activate it. You can also upload the plugin zip under **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**.
3. Go to **Tickets → Setup → Payment** and open the **Mobile Money (MTN / Airtel)** section:
   - Set **Enabled** to Yes.
   - Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Shashura app (see [Getting your Shashura API credentials](#getting-your-shashura-api-credentials) below).
   - Choose **Sandbox** while testing. Switch to **Production** only when ready to take real payments.
   - Enter the **Webhook Secret** shown on your Shashura app. Mobile Money is not offered at checkout until this is set.
   - API endpoints are controlled by trusted deployment code; see [ENDPOINT-POLICY.md](ENDPOINT-POLICY.md).
   - If the site is behind a proxy or load balancer, set **Visitor IP from** to the header it sends, and **Trusted proxies** to the number of proxies in front of the site (usually 1).
   - **Show "Powered by Shashura"** is off by default. Tick it to show a small credit link below the payment pages.
4. Copy the webhook URL shown under Webhook Secret and set it as the **Callback URL** on the matching app in your Shashura dashboard.
5. Ask Shashura to whitelist your server's outbound IP address for that app. Requests from an IP that is not whitelisted are rejected.
6. Save your settings. The **Connection** line confirms whether the credentials authenticate successfully.

To keep the credentials out of the database, define them in `wp-config.php` instead. The matching fields then show "Set in wp-config.php":

```php
define( 'SHASMOMO_CLIENT_ID', 'PID_...' );
define( 'SHASMOMO_CLIENT_SECRET', '...' );
define( 'SHASMOMO_WEBHOOK_SECRET', '...' );
```

## Getting your Shashura API credentials

This plugin needs three values from your Shashura merchant account: a **Client ID**, a **Client Secret**, and a **Webhook Secret**. All three are issued from the Apps page of your Shashura merchant dashboard.

1. Log in to your Shashura merchant dashboard at [shashura.com](https://shashura.com) and open the **Apps** page. If you don't have an account yet, sign up there first.
2. Click **Create App** and give it a name, such as your event site's name. Shashura generates a Sandbox credential pair and a Production credential pair for the app at the same time, along with a Webhook Signing Secret, so there's no separate step to request production access later.
3. The Apps page lists each Client ID against its environment:
   - Client ID: **SANDBOX** begins with `TID_`. Use this, with its matching Client Secret, while Environment is set to Sandbox in this plugin.
   - Client ID: **PRODUCTION** begins with `PID_`. Use this, with its matching Client Secret, once Environment is switched to Production.
   - Client Secret is hidden by default. Use the reveal icon to display it on screen, or the regenerate icon to issue a new one. Regenerating immediately invalidates the previous secret, so update this plugin's settings straight after.
4. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret for the environment you're configuring into this plugin's Payment settings.
5. Reveal the **Webhook Signing Secret** (begins with `whsec_`) on the same Apps page and copy it into this plugin's Webhook Secret field.
6. Copy the webhook URL this plugin displays under its Webhook Secret field and paste it into the **Callback URL** field for the same app on the Apps page.
7. Ask Shashura to whitelist your server's outbound IP address for this app, so callbacks and settlement checks are accepted.

Because each app holds both a Sandbox and a Production credential pair, going live does not require creating a new app; only switching this plugin's Environment setting to Production and swapping in the Production Client ID and Secret from the same Apps page.

## FAQ

**Which currencies are supported?**
Uganda Shillings (UGX) only, matching Shashura's Mobile Money coverage.

**Does this plugin process refunds?**
Yes. Use CampTix's own "Refund" button on the attendee screen — full, partial, and refund-all are all supported. Only the amount the organizer actually received is reversed; Shashura's processing fee is not refunded. The attendee gets the refunded amount back on the same phone number that paid.

**What happens if a buyer closes the browser tab after approving the PIN prompt?**
The payment still settles. Shashura's webhook, and CampTix's own timeout check on CampTix 2.x, both ask Shashura directly whether the order was paid, independently of whether the buyer's browser is still open.

**Can I switch between Sandbox and Production while orders are still open?**
Avoid it. A prompt sent under one environment cannot be checked while the plugin is configured for the other. It stays in a waiting state, never shown as failed, until the environment is switched back.

**Where do I see what happened on a specific order?**
Open the attendee's edit screen under **Tickets → Attendees**. The CampTix log on that screen records every check, error, amount mismatch or duplicate-payment warning for that order.

**Can this connect to a Shashura deployment other than the public default?**
Yes. A trusted deployment operator can set SHASMOMO_BASE_URL or use shasmomo_base_url. Per-site URL settings are ignored. See [ENDPOINT-POLICY.md](ENDPOINT-POLICY.md).

## External services

This plugin connects to the **Shashura Mobile Money API** to collect ticket payments. This is required functionality: without it, the plugin cannot verify mobile numbers, push PIN prompts, or confirm payment, since Mobile Money collection can only happen through a licensed Mobile Money aggregator.

What is sent, and when:

- **Number verification**: when a buyer enters a mobile number at checkout, that number is sent to Shashura to look up the registered account name on the MTN/Airtel network, shown to the buyer for confirmation before anything is charged.
- **Payment request**: once the buyer confirms, the mobile number, the order total, and an order reference are sent to Shashura to push a PIN prompt to the buyer's phone.
- **Status confirmation**: after a prompt is sent, this plugin asks Shashura directly whether the referenced payment succeeded (and Shashura also notifies this plugin via a signed webhook). No card numbers, mobile money PINs, or other site data are sent.
- These calls happen only when a buyer actually attempts a Mobile Money payment at checkout, never on a page load with no checkout activity.

## Privacy

**Subscriber-name visibility:** A checkout visitor can enter a supported Ugandan phone number that does not belong to them. Shashura's number verification can return the account holder's registered name. By default, this plugin does not display that name to the visitor. Site administrators may opt in to a partial or full name under Tickets → Setup → Payment → Account name shown to buyer. Showing a name can disclose personal information to third parties; describe this behaviour in the event site's privacy notice. Rate limiting reduces automated enumeration but does not verify number ownership. The gateway may still return and the plugin may temporarily store the name for payment processing even when its display is disabled.

While a payment request is open, the plugin keeps the buyer's full mobile number. Once the request is settled (paid, failed or rejected), only a masked number (+256 77* *** 456) is kept.

Against each paid order, this plugin stores the payer's registered name, a masked mobile number, the mobile network, and the Shashura transaction reference, for reconciliation and support. Stored phone numbers and names are included in WordPress's own **Tools → Export Personal Data** and **Erase Personal Data** tools, so data-subject requests are handled through core WordPress, not a separate process. This plugin never handles or stores card numbers, mobile money PINs, or Shashura account credentials.

CampTix writes each payment result to its own order log, which WordPress's Erase Personal Data tool does not reach. The payer's name and masked number are therefore not included in the payment data this plugin passes to CampTix. Log entries written by earlier versions may still contain them; if a person asks for erasure, those entries have to be cleaned up in the database. The name and number kept on the payment attempt itself are still covered by the export and erase tools.

## Development

You need PHP 7.4 or newer with the zip extension, and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```bash
composer install     # coding standards tools (development only)
composer test        # run the regression tests in tests/
composer lint        # check the code against the WordPress Coding Standards (phpcs.xml.dist)
composer build       # build build/shashura-mobile-money-for-camptix.zip
php bin/check-zip.php
```

`composer build` leaves out everything listed in `.distignore` (tests, workflows, screenshots, Composer files and these docs). `bin/check-zip.php` then confirms that every plugin file is in the zip, that no development file got in, and that the plugin version matches the readme's stable tag. GitHub Actions runs both on every push and pull request and keeps the zip as a build artifact.

The plugin has no Composer runtime dependencies, so the zip never includes `vendor/`.
